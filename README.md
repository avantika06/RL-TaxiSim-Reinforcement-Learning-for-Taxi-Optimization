# RL-TaxiSim-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Taxi-Optimization
Implemented Q-Learning, SARSA, and DQN in OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v3 to train agents for efficient taxi routing. Compared algorithm performance, visualized learning, and achieved 30% improvement in pick-up/drop-off efficiency using reward optimization and policy evaluation.
